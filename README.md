# Survey Analysis with Bar Chart

  This is a project to analyze the results of a Survey with 2233 participants
  about how interested they are in selected Data Science areas. They had the
  options Very Interested, Somewhat Interested and Not Interested to pick
  for 6 different areas.
  
  First I performed the Data wrangling to prepare the data for data 
  visualization, selecting and transforming it to percentage.
  
  The project had the requirement to use Matplotlib Artist Layer
  to plot the Bar Chart and it specified fontsize, color and that
  percent value of each bar should be on top of it, where then I
  used patches for that task.
