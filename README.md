# Survey Analysis with Bar Chart

- **Main Objective:** Plot a chart to visualize the % of participants interested in Data Science by area.

  This is a project to analyze the results of a Survey with 2233 participants
  about how interested they are in selected Data Science areas. They had the
  options Very Interested, Somewhat Interested and Not Interested to pick
  for 6 different areas.
  
  First I performed the Data wrangling to prepare the data for data 
  visualization, selecting and transforming it to percentage.
  
  The project requested the use of Matplotlib Artist Layer
  to plot the Bar Chart and also specified fontsize, color and that
  percent value of each bar should be on top of it, where then I
  used patches for that task.

- **Results:** A Bar Chart  to visualize the analysis of the interests of the participants
by each area concerning Data Science.

- **Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
  
- **Keywords:** Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Wrangling
